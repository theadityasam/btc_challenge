# Bitcoin Test

## Problem

Bitcoin miners construct blocks by selecting a set of transactions from their mempool. Each transaction in the mempool:
includes a fee which is collected by the miner if that transaction is included in a block has a weight , which indicates the size of the transaction may have one or more parent transactions which are also in the mempool. The miner selects an ordered list of transactions which have a combined weight below the maximum block weight.
`mempool.csv` is an example mempool of the form `<txid>,<fee>,<weight>,<parent_txids>`

- `txid` is the transaction identifier
- `fee` is the transaction fee
- `weight` is the transaction weight
- `parent_txids` is a list of the txids of the transactionâ€™s unconfirmed parent transactions (confirmed parent transactions are not included in this list). It is of the form: \<txid1\>;\<txid2\>;...

The goal is to read <mark>mempool.csv</mark> and generate a new block of transactions with the following constraints -

- Transactions with parent transactions in the mempool may be included in the list, but only if all of their parents appear before them in the list.
- The miner should ideally include the transactions that maximize the total fee.
- The output from the program should be txids, separated by newlines, which make a valid block.
- Transactions MUST appear in order (no transaction should appear before one of its parents).

## Approach

**The real code resides in the CodeFile folder. My final submission solution is in [`solutions.py`](https://github.com/theadityasam/btc_challenge/blob/main/CodeFile/solution.py). I've created some utility/helper functions and they reside in [`utils.py`](https://github.com/theadityasam/btc_challenge/blob/main/CodeFile/utils.py)**. The utility functions that I've created are the file parser, valid transactions selector, text file generator and the final result summary generator/result tester. Rest of the files are basically work in progress wherein I'm extending the capabilities of this msall tool by adding more algorithms and a more versatile tool.

The task can basically be broken down into 4 stages. Our script file must take in a CSV, operate on it and dump a `.txt` file with valid transaction IDs. My choice of weapon was Python. **The Jupyter Notebook (solution.ipynb) is my test grounds wherein I test code snippets and validate them for different inputs.** Hence, this file can be ignored as it's just a test file. The driver code basically performs the following function sequentially -

- **Parsing the CSV** - This step includes reading lines from the given csv and splitting the line by "," (comma) and returning a list of lists. This is as simple as opening a file and running the following

```
[line.strip().split(',') for line in f.readlines()]
```

Every sub-list within the list contains "trans_id, trans_fees, trans_weight, parent_string" in order.

- **Extracting Valid Transactions** - We know that the transactions in the mempool are ordered. The condition is that for a transaction to proceed, the parent transactions should occur before the child. Hence, to make sure this property is adhered, we'll iterate over the list and add transaction ID's to a set, say "parent_set". At every step, we'll check if the set of parents of that transaction is a subset of the "parent_set" that we're keeping a track of. If yes then that transaction is considered as a valid possible mempool transaction.

```
block_ids = []
    block_fee = []
    block_wts = []
    parent_set = set()
    for x in parsed:
        if x[1].isnumeric() and x[2].isnumeric():
            if x[3] == "" or parent_set.issuperset(x[3].split(';')):
                parent_set.add(x[0])
                block_ids.append(x[0])
                block_fee.append(int(x[1]))
                block_wts.append(int(x[2]))
```

This returns 3 lists, one for transactions IDs, one for transaction fees and one for the transaction weights.

- **Getting Optimal Transactions** -
  - The Greedy Approach - This is by far the simplest and the fastest approach to tackle this task. Our goal is to maximise fees by adding transactions and also, not overshoot the maximum block weight. To solve this, we can basically sort the transactions on the basis of the "value" they carry, and then select the first `n` transactions that have a collective weight under 4x10<sup>6</sup>. The value of a transaction can be determined by simple diving the block fees by it's weight. We sort the mempool list based on this criteria in descending order and then iterate from the beginning, filling our new block till it reaches maximum block weight. This is quite a fast algrotihm with excellent results. **This method is my final submission for the BTC challenge - `[solution.py](https://github.com/theadityasam/btc_challenge/blob/main/CodeFile/solution.py) [block.txt](https://github.com/theadityasam/btc_challenge/blob/main/block.txt)`**
 ![Greedy Algo](https://github.com/theadityasam/btc_challenge/blob/main/images/greedy_solution.png)
  - Using Dynamic Programming - The biggest benefit of DP is that we're guranteed to obtain a global optimal solution. However the compromises are made in runtime and space complexity as we shall see soon. I'm implementing this and the genetic algorithm just for fun. We have two lists under consideration - fees and weights. Our objective is to **maximise the fees** possible, yet keep the **total block weight under maximum allowed block weight**. This is a classical problem of **0-1 Knapsack**. This method has been implemented in my code with the classical tabulation way, i.e. I created a NumPy table and store the results of the sub-problems in that table. We find the most optimal value for the first **i** elements, where **i** is in range **[0,1,2...,n-1,n]** Hence our final answer is stored in the bottom-rightmost element. Although the implementation is quite easy, it has one major drawback - the time and space complexity i.e. O(N\*W) where N is number of items and W is the maximum possible weight. For the given maximum block size of 4x10<sup>6</sup>, running the algo for **mempool.csv** takes **24-25hours**! (can be seen in the following image, bottom right corner. 8mins, 59secs have elapsed and 25hours, 7mins and 52secs are ;left).
    ![Mempool DP](https://github.com/theadityasam/btc_challenge/blob/main/images/mempool_dp.png)
    The DP algorithm can be optimised for space, there is an O(W) solution as well bringing down the space complexity and the runtimes as well, however this is a minor improvement and won't impact the 24hours runtime much. There are alternative algorithms for calculating the optimal solution like the **Greedy or Genetic algorithms**. However, we then have to make a compromise on the optimality of the solution for the algo runtimes. For now, I'm considering creating the **DP function in C++ and creating Python bindings to call them**. Runtime difference between c++ and Python loops vary between 10x-25x. Even in worst cast, it might be able to bring down the runtime from 24hours to 2.4hours.
  For testing the solution, **I've selected a few transactions** from "mempool.csv" and created a ["trial.csv"](https://github.com/theadityasam/btc_challenge/blob/main/trial.csv) test file. I've selected transactions with many different conditions, transactions with:
  - No parents
  - With single parent that hasn't occured before
  - With single parent that has occured before
  - With multiple parents, some of them haven't occured before
  - With multiple parents, all of them have occured before
  - Transitive parents i.e. parents that have occured before but cannot be included as their parents haven't occured before

- **Dumping to a text file** - This step is a simple, opening the file and writing lines to it. The generated file name is of the form - **"_filename_ current_time_in_UTC"**. If no filename is provided, `"Blocklist"` is considered as default. The generated files can be checked in the repo. You can check the last two "Blocklist..txt" that have been generated for "trial.csv". `[Final Solution] - Block.txt](https://github.com/theadityasam/btc_challenge/blob/main/block.txt)`

## Caveats

- Assumes all the parent IDs are unique (No two transactions have the same ID)
- The numpy DP method has a time complexity of O(N\*W) and O(N\*W) where N is the total number of items and W is the max weight. This translates to huge runtimes for a max block weight of 4 million. 

## Improvements I'm Working On

- Wrapping driver in a main function and passing parameters as command line arguments.
- Wrap utilities in class for cleaner codes.
- Add Genetic Algorithms, cleaner DP implementation
